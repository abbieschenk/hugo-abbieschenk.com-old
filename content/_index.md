Iâ€™m Abbie Schenk, a **software developer** and **photographer**. I'm interested in conveying information and stories in interdisciplenary ways, combining interactive web apps, digital mapping, photography, video, writing, and other methods.

I use this website to catalog **[Projects](/projects)** and write **[Posts](/posts)** about them, my processes, and other thoughts on **work** and **leisure**.

My **software development** experience is mainly in **Java**, with 3+ years of professional experience and a **BSc. in Computing Science**. I've also used a lot of Javascript and CSS, Unity3D, and done some Android app development.

I've also worked in multimedia content creation, digital communications, and various roles at the University of Alberta. My **Master of Arts in Recreation and Leisure Studies** thesis used photography to examine travel as a meaningful, transitional time.

# Work
Some of my work can be found on the **[Projects](/projects)** page. My resume and CV are also available on request.

# Contact
I'm always open to hearing about opportunities to collaborate and work with like-minded people. The best way to reach me is via **[email](mailto:abbieschenk@gmail.com)**.
