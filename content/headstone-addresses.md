[Headstone Addresses](https://headstoneaddresses.com/) is a spatiotemporal data visualization of cemetary headstones linked to their home addresses in China. It is a community project from the 2020 Digital Heritage Experiences grants stream. The project was supported by the Edmonton Heritage Council and the City of Edmonton.


My involvement with the project included assisting with gathering data in three Edmonton cemetaries with project lead (and my spouse) Elaine Yip, and then creating a data visualization that linked the gathered headstone data to birth date, burial date, and home address location.

More information about the project can be found on its [About page](https://headstoneaddresses.com/about). The source code is up on [GitHub](https://github.com/abbieschenk/headstone-addresses), and the site is deployed with Netlify.

I built the data visualization using d3.js, and the site itself with Gatsby. The project was completed successfully on a short timeline â€” I'm still making some improvements on code quality and performance. But overall it has been well received as a research and research dissemination tool.
